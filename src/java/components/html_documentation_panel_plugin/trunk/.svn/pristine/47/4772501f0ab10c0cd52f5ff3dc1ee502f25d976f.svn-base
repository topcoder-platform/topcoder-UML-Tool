TO RUN:

1. Install the component structure in ${basedir}

2. Create "topcoder_global.properties" in ${basedir}/.. and add the properties from steps 2,3,4

3. The following standard build script properties must be set
	ext_libdir - root of third party libraries
	tcs_libdir - root of topcoder components
	java_1_5_bootclasspath - installation path for java 1.5 (only needed for compile_targets task)

4. The following standard build script properties can be changed (defaults are noted)
	debug=off - as expected
	verbose=no - as expected
	cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8
		installation directory of cobertura script expects {$cobertura.dir}/cobertura.jar
		and {$cobertura.dir}/lib/containg Jars for asm, jakarta, and log4j to run cobertura task

5. The following properties need to be set for this component
	None

NB:
	The folder ${basedir}/test_reflib contains TopCoder components
	that are required by this component's test code. This component is
	used to by compile_test and test targets. Components are listed under
	the following directory structure "component name"/"component version".
	Components are provided AS IS for development purposes only.

	Included: None.

6. This component requires following third party component.
	6.1. easymock 2.2
	6.2. jmock 1.2.0
	6.3. HSQLDB (http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/) is used for stress test cases.
	A table named "stress_test" should be created before running stress test cases, and its scheme can be found in table.sql.
	Also, any other relational database can be used, in that case, you have to modify the related code yourself.

7. Setup the test environment:
	7.1. run hsqldb\1.8.0\demo\runServer.bat
	7.2. run hsqldb\1.8.0\demo\runManager.bat
	7.3. select HSQL Database Engine Server
	7.4. create stress_test table.
