0) New tests were added to cover the UI/functionality changes in V1.1(e.g. horizontal layout)
   Develper is not reqired to write tests for those code that is not changed in V1.1
   
1) JFCUnit
   jakarta regexp and jfcunit are reqired to run the tests. They are included in this submission.
   Testing takes about 2 minutes.

2) Demo
   go to test_files\demo and execute run.cmd
   You will see how this properties panel works with TC UML Tool. (You must build this component first)

3) The docs apart the RS are the same as the ones belonging to v1.0 since the changes in this version are
lied to the appearance and not to the functionality of the component.
