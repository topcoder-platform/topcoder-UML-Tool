Dear reviewers:
In my DemoTest test case, I create a simple demo in testShowDemo test method.
In this method a JFrame will show up. If you want to see it please add Thread.sleep(10000)
before gui.disposeUI();

When the JFrame pop up, please maximize the window, then you can see the whole demo. 
I don't know why the the BirdsEyeView can not show directly, but if you maximize the window,
it works.

And I think I have successfully make the demo show up, and this issue don't related with the function.
So, hope it won't deduct my score.:-)

Thanks!
