
  Installation Requirements
  -------------------------
  JDK 1.4.2  <http://java.sun.com>
  Apache Ant 1.6.5  <http://www.apache.org>
  JUnit 3.8.1  <http://www.junit.org>
      Note: The junit.jar should be located inside the Ant lib/ directory in 
      order to build the component test cases.
  
  
  TopCoder Software Environment Configuration
  -------------------------------------------
  TopCoder Software has defined a directory structure to promote component reuse
  and facilitate Component Based Development.
  
  Steps to setting up your environment:
  1- Designate a directory on your file system to be used as your TCS_HOME.
     (i.e. c:\tcs or /etc/home/user/tcs)
  2- Copy the sample topcoder_global.properties located in this distribution to your TCS_HOME directory.
     (If the sample does not exists, you can create your own.
      Using a text editor, create a file named topcoder_global.properties in your TCS_HOME directory.
      This file will be used to overwrite any Ant build properties defined in each TopCoder Software 
      component build script.)
  3- The topcoder_global.properties is used to overwrite properties defined in each component's build.xml file.
     This setup gives you the flexibility to define where files exist and what version all components should use.
     
     When overwriting properties, use the PROPERTYNAME=PROPERTYVALUE format.
     To overwrite the TopCoder Software /lib and 3rd party /lib directories, set these properties in
     the topcoder_global.properties file:
     
     tcs_libdir={PATH}
     ext_libdir={PATH}
     
     For Example:
     tcs_libdir=e:/tcs/cvs/tcs/lib/tcs
     ext_libdir=e:/tcs/cvs/tcs/lib
     
     Notes: Only define one property per line.
          : Enter text at the begining of the line.
          : Do not include any whitespace.
          
     By overwriting the ext_libdir property, any reference to this property will now point to the new directory.
     Some properties that use the ext_libdir property include junit.jar and xerces.jar.
     If you prefer to define the location of xerces.jar specifically, you can also set xerces.jar in the 
     topcoder_global.properties file.
          
  4- All TopCoder Software components are distributed with Ant (ant.apache.org) based build scripts
     and Junit (www.junit.org) based test cases.  Please properly install and configure these tools 
     before working with TopCoder Software components.
     Note: Be sure to place the junit.jar in the ANT_HOME/lib directory.
  
  
  Thanks for using TopCoder Software components!
