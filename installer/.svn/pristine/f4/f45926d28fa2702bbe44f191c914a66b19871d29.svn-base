terminate your license to the Software, and/or (ii) pursue all other available

to abide by all applicable government laws, rules and regulations, including

virus or surreptitious code to, or deliberately disable or impair operation of
the systems, software, or data of TopCoder or any other party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED
INFORMATION PROVIDED ON TOPCODER'S WEBSITES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL
SOURCE CODE, COMPONENT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTS, AND ALL TOPCODER
MEMBER INFORMATION) ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS-IS.&quot;&nbsp; IN ADDITION, TOPCODER
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT
OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.&nbsp; TOPCODER
MAKES NO AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSED
UNDER THIS TOPCODER UML TOOL LICENSE AGREEMENT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES  You acknowledge
that the operation and availability of the communications systems used for
downloading the Software (e.g., computer networks and the Internet) can be
unpredictable and may, from time to time, interfere with or prevent access to the
Software.&nbsp; TopCoder is not in any way responsible for any such
interference with or prevention of your use of or access to the Software.  IN
NO EVENT SHALL TOPCODER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS,
LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS OR INVESTMENT OR THE LIKE) WHETHER BASED ON
BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER
LEGAL THEORY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF SUCH DAMAGES.&nbsp;

PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11.  The limitations of damages or liability set forth in
this Agreement are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between
TopCoder and you. You acknowledge and agree that TopCoder would not be able to
provide the Software on an economic basis without such limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12.  INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  If
TopCoder becomes aware or reasonably believes that the Software licensed to you
under this Agreement may infringe the intellectual property rights of a third
party, TopCoder may at TopCoder’s discretion: (i) procure for you the right to
continue to use the Software, or (ii) modify or replace the Software to make
your use non-infringing while being capable of performing substantially the
same function;, or (iii) terminate this Agreement.  At the request of TopCoder,
you shall provide TopCoder with a list of all copies and locations of the Software,
including Software that have been merged with other software and/or source code. 
TopCoder may, from time to time, upon written notice to you, perform an audit
of your use of the Software and your compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.  The Software may include modifications developed by
people other than TopCoder.  If you have not received the Software directly
from TopCoder, such modifications may be subject to their own license terms.
See the documentation accompanying the software for more information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'>MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14.  TopCoder shall have the right to immediately terminate
your access to or use of the Software in the event of any activities which are
in breach of this Agreement or conduct which, in TopCoder's judgment,
interferes with the operation or the use of the Software or the TopCoder web
site. Termination of this Agreement automatically terminates your license and
authorization to access the Software and any content or other material
contained therein. TopCoder is entitled to enforce its rights hereunder by an
action for damages or for specific performance, injunctive or other equitable
relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15.  TopCoder will not provide any technical support,
including phone support, for any of the Software licensed hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16.  In connection with your use of the Software, you agree
to be identified as a customer of TopCoder and grant TopCoder permission to
refer to your company by name, trade name and/or trademark, if applicable, and
to briefly describe your company's business in TopCoder's marketing material,
press releases and on its websites for the sole purpose of promoting your use
of the Software.&nbsp; You represent and warrant that you have the right to grant
such permission, and that you are a duly authorized representative of your
company, and you are able to enter into and perform this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17.  Headings are included for convenience only, and shall
not be considered in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement does not limit
any rights that TopCoder may have under trade secret, trademark, copyright,
patent or other laws. The employees of TopCoder are not authorized to make
modifications to this Agreement, or to make any additional representations,
commitments, or warranties binding on TopCoder, except in writing signed by an
authorized officer of TopCoder. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be, to that extent, deemed
omitted and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18.  This Agreement and any rights granted hereunder are
personal and shall not be assigned, sublicensed or encumbered, directly or
indirectly, by law or by contract, by you without the prior written consent of
TopCoder.  TopCoder shall have the right to directly or indirectly sell,
transfer, assign or delegate in whole or in part this Agreement, or any rights,
duties, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, by operation of law or
otherwise.&nbsp; This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the permitted successors and assigns of the parties hereto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19.  Upon reasonable request by TopCoder, you shall, and
shall require each of your subcontractors, employees and agents to execute and
deliver such further certificates, acknowledgments, waivers and/or assignments

<p class=MsoNormal>Appendix A – Attribution Information</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a modest attribution to TopCoder, in the hope that its
promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested by
TopCoder in the development of the Software, each time an application that
includes any portion of the Software in any way is operated (which includes
initiating a session), a prominent display of TopCoder’s Attribution Graphic
Image must occur at all times on the graphic user interface employed by the end
user to access such application of sufficient size to be clearly legible and
recognizable by the end user.  If the Software already displays such
attribution information in a particular form, continued use of such form for
that attribution is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the Attribution Copyright Notice must be maintained
where provided in the Software, and the Attribution Phrase included in
documentation accompanying modified Software.</p>
