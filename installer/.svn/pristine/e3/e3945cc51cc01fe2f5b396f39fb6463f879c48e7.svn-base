Notes:

1. Setting up the installer build
	a. Download and install izPack (http://www.izpack.org)
	b. Change izpack.dir in ../build.xml to point to your izPack install
	c. Run "ant build_installer" using ../build.xml
	d. Installer will be placed in ../build/ and is ready to be distributed

2. Installing the UML tool.
	a. Make sure the machine you are installing on has the proper version 
		of Java (1.7)
	b. Execute installer jar. The OS may support doing this in the GUI, or 
		you can use the command line: 
		java -jar UML_Tool_Frontend_installer-1.2.6.jar
	c. Follow instructions on installer screen

3. Uninstalling the UML tool.
	a. An icon should be created for the uninstaller (if you selected to 
		install icons, and if the izPack installer supports icons for 
		your OS).
	b. If there is no icon, or for some reason you wish to uninstall 
		manually, go to wherever you installed the app and run the 
		Uninstaller\uninstaller.jar file. This can be done in the GUI 
		if your OS supports it, or else run java -jar uninstaller.jar 
		from the Uninstaller directory.

4. Issues (Only applies to installer issues, not to the app):
	- Some operating systems supposedly don't support creating shortcuts 
		(icons) according to izPack documentation.
